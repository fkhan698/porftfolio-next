Earlier this weekend after spending 2 months consistently studying, I passed my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam.
I went from having little exposure to any of AWS services to getting a broad overall understanding of everything.

# Why Did I Pursue This?

I decided to pursue this certification because I knew that a lot of big companies and software projects use AWS. I also had previous exposure to AWS
with a project I had worked on before at my previous employer. I was curious to learn more and getting deeper understanding of the architecture. I spent
the first month going through Stephane Marreck's Udemy course and the 2nd month doing Tutorial Dojos practice tests. It took quite a bit of time, but at the end I believe I got a
solid understanding of AWS, which I think is quite valuable.

# What's Next?

Although I may have passed the certification I believe I have barely scratched the surface. Now it's time for me to put my knowledge to practice. I plan on creating some
web applications that utilize some of the services I learned about. I hope to make a post about some of the things I learned about in the near future.
